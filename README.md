# NLP Document Analysis

This Python code provides functionalities for Natural Language Processing (NLP)-based document analysis. It includes classes and methods to preprocess text, categorize documents, analyze sentiment, extract key phrases, and recognize named entities.

## Usage

1. **Document Class**: Represents a text document to be analyzed. It includes the following attributes:
   - `text`: The raw text of the document.
   - `tokens`: List of tokens (words) after preprocessing.
   - `categories`: List of assigned categories.
   - `sentiment`: Overall sentiment (positive, negative, neutral).
   - `key_phrases`: List of extracted key phrases.
   - `named_entities`: Dictionary of named entity types and their values.

   **Methods**:
   - `pre_process()`: Performs basic text preprocessing, including tokenization and lowercasing.

2. **NDAA (NLP Document Analysis Application) Class**: Core functionalities for document analysis. It includes the following attributes:
   - `classifier`: Trained classifier for document categorization.
   - `sentiment_analyzer`: SentimentIntensityAnalyzer from NLTK for sentiment analysis.
   - `named_entity_recognizer`: Named Entity Recognizer model for recognizing named entities.

   **Methods**:
   - `categorize_document(document)`: Categorizes a document using a pre-trained classifier (replace with actual model).
   - `analyze_sentiment(document)`: Analyzes the overall sentiment of a document.
   - `extract_key_phrases(document)`: Extracts key phrases from the document (placeholder).
   - `recognize_named_entities(document)`: Identifies and classifies named entities (replace with actual NER model).

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)

Before using the code, ensure you have NLTK installed. If not, you can install it via pip:

```bash
pip install nltk
